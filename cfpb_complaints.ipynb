Necessary documents were submitted by XXXX. After initial review, got good faith estimate with loan amount and closing cost. Based on this estimate, a deposit of {$350.00} was made towards appraisal. Appraisal came with lesser amount by {$5000.00}. Agreed to reduce the loan amount to that extent. However, got a revised estimate which was less by {$30000.00} and with additional closing cost towards points etc. In between got numerous revised estimates with different loan amounts and closing cost. It took more than 2 months to reach any definite closing document. Hence, want to get back the deposit of {$350.00}.   \n",

In XXXX Bank I have my checking account and is easier for me to pay my loans. I want to consolidate all my loans here. \\nI also need your help to review my account in this Bank ( Caliber Home Loans ) because they are charging escrow amount that I am not agreed. \\nThanks XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX   \n",

       "2017-03-19     My credit report is being negatively affected by BB & T as a result of extremely poor account management and customer service following a disputed transaction. This experience has also been met with poor treatment ( in person ) by a BB & T Vice President who treated me in a rude and very unfair manner at first introduction. Without receiving any notification or account statements over a long period of time between the date of discrepancy through present I was finally contacted by a collections team at BBT about a past due amount slightly over {$30.00}. Upon that first contact the collections team was unable to provide any explanation as to what the amount in question was from or when the transaction had taken place. I believe the root cause of this to be a result of fraudulent activity to which I have a fraud dispute placed on an account with BB & T for activity that I believe may have some sort of relation to a PII breach and theft of my XXXX IRS XXXX from XXXX a former employer. ...   \n",
